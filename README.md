# Neutral-News
Web application that categorizes news articles as either liberal or conservative, so the user has a more balanced news feed to form political opinions from. </br>
This contains only my contributions, which were primarily in the front end using HTML/CSS/Javascript and the Material Design framework (https://getmdl.io/).
